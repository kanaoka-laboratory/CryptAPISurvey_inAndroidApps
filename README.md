Survey of cryptographic APIs in Android
====
日本語版READMEは[こちら](/README-jp.md)

Usable security research targeting software developers is becoming more and more active.
Among them, research focusing on how developers use cryptography has been attracting attention. 
These studies focused on specific cryptographic techniques (e.g., algorithms, IVs, and block cipher modes of operation of symmetric key cryptography) to explore their appropriate use. 

The main use of cryptography in software is through the use of cryptographic libraries, but it is not yet known which cryptographic libraries are used and how they are used in actual software.

In this page, we introduce the results of our survey, and the data and tools related to the survey.

Description of Androzoo data
====

## Data Overview
Androzoo provides a list of collected APKs and their respective APK files, which are downloaded by using the hash value of the APK file in the list.

The list file is comma-separated text data. Each line contains information for one application. 
The information in each column is as follows
```sha256,sha1,md5,dex_date,apk_size,pkg_name,vercode,vt_detection,vt_scan_date,dex_size,markets```
Hash values are written in HEX.

## Data used in this study
The list data used in this study for analysis was as of September 7, 2019.
The list had 9,674,292 files listed.

## List of applications surveyed for cryptographic library extraction
For the cryptographic library extraction, we analyzed 247,000 Android applications.
We provide the list here.
The hash value listed is the hash value of the application used for the analysis, which is the application included in the Androzoo list above.
